=====================

Some CSS transition functions and keyframe animations that I've found useful.

## Note - This isn't even nearly finished yet. It's a work in progress.

## Progress

### Complete
* Add the initial Sass files.

### To Do
* Add the Sass mixins required.
* Add a gruntfile so stylesheets can be rebuilt.
* Add the compiled CSS files.
* Document the styles.
* Create a demo page.
